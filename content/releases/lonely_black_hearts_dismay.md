After two years away from playing live Stars and the Underground are looking
forward to bringing their unique hybrid post-punk/synthwave sound with
shoegaze textures back to the stage in 2025.

Members John Mason originally of Auckland band Winterland and John
McDermott a drummer who has played with the likes of the Headless Chickens
have teamed up to an record album “Guardians of the Night”

We are excited to start sharing results of our collective efforts live and the first
single “Lonely Black Hearts” from the new album and an accompanying video
will be released on the first of April, 2025.

The single includes remixes from Elenor Rayner (Robots in Love) and Ant
Banister of Sydney bands Sounds Like Winter and Sequential Zero.
