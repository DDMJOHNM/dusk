**Concierto Solidario - Radio Subte Lima Sur(Peru) Live Stream**

{{< youtube XewjDrjTW7o >}}  
 
This video was shot for Radio Subte Lima Sur and was played on a big screen at the benefit concert so that 
the disadvantaged children of Villa Mar√≠a del Triunfo could enjoy some Christmas cheer. 

Thank you to the late Daniel D (DANIEL SIEMPRE PRESENTE), Cristian Murillo and Milagros Rivera 
who supported us by playing Nosferatu Upon Tyne during our single release 2020 during covid. 

Wonderful music people, even though we spoke different languages they always understood.

Taken from a live performance from the Whammy Back Room circa 2019 (Evolution Circle Release and Tour) Mark projected visuals 
on to a back drop behind while Sean and I performed.

This was the second video we did and was for the single off the Evolution Circle (2019) shot in the North Head Tunnels on the North Shore 
of Auckland very appropriate as it was an old stomping ground mutually for Mark and I as children.
Well we still havent grown up have we...  

These great videos are the work of Mark Wallbank (Hieronymous Bosch/Paranormal New Zealand/Club Bizzare/Bizarre Beats).

Without his support and creativity and inspiration our releases would be diminished.

Thank you Mark.
