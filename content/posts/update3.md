So i'd say this recording process is the most isolated I've ever undertaken, long hours    
tracking before sending tracks off and thankfully John's been at the other end of line
to bounce ideas off of. 

If I had my choice it would be different but thats a coversation for another day.  

One of the biggest and closest losses of my life happened just recently with my father passing 
away. 

I am and will continue to be for quite some time trying to reconcile what I saw what 
happened to him and how quickly it happened. 

One part of the Gothic plane to me is that you become familiar with well, darkness. 

Unlike what you might think it's not about depression although it could be and there  
is no shame in that, it could be about finding beauty in that darkness and in fact you welcome it as a familiar friend.    

The sombre tones, the deep resonant lilting drone of that bass, the dry ice, and in those days the entire packet of cigarettes you smoked and hence the smell you tried to get out of clothes for the next week.

The smell of make up, perfume and the audience which always looked better than what we did but overall and overwhelmingly and impressively the warmth of such people that dwealt in the cold.

For me fear has always racked my thoughts, but less and less now as there was always the thought that these 
darkest of things that you surround yourself with make it easier to deal with life.    

Thats some really bad shit but, that's not really that bad you get desensitised to it, perhaps deliberately.  

Thats always why I celebrate the dark and communicate through such a filter, it's not about fashion its not about 
knowing whom the lead singer of band x is.   

I love those things, but its always about reconciling experiences that you have through this dark filter to find comfort.

By way of example. 

The song we are working on at the moment is called "Here comes the Midnight Chord" 



It goes something like...

```

Our best laid plans, they come undone 

Opportunity slips through the cracks in the floor

Don't waste the time you have, don't waste it any more  

The days are precious and so are your thoughts


Here comes the Midnight Chord 
theres danger here and chaos involved.


Take Charon's Obel for the trip to underworld  

Our dearest and departed lost across the rivers Styx and Acheron

Honor your loved ones, honor your dead 

They are part of your own ascent

Remember when the cold sets in 

It's their warmth that will never relent


Here comes the Midnight Chord 
theres danger here and chaos involved.


For "Don" Donald Jack Mason  
12th December 1938 - 27th November 2023
