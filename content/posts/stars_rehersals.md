Stars and the Underground will once again meet in the rehersal room to start working on their set and an as yet undetermined song to be released as a single.
 
The band is in high spirits and have been wildly investing in new equipment with a view to refining 
the bands sound we look forward to seeing what emerges.

There will be some live shows announced once we are happy with where things are at and we hope to hook up with a few acts weve been talking to since last year about playing together.

John, Cat, Ari, Matt.
