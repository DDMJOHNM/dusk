I thought it would be a good idea to start posting and letting people interested in our music what was happening. 

Naturally out of habit or poor planning i've spent alot of time over the hotter months when everybody sensible is out either playing live
or enjoying their holidays or concerts inside recording and working toward getting in shape for playing live again.  

To date the album "Guardians of the Night" is well and truely on track with three tracks completed and another three over with John Mcdermott  
presently. 

Once he finishes his drums parts he sends them back for final track laying I send them back to him once i'm finished for mix 
and mastering.

I think the thing that has surprised me about the new material is the ease with which it straddles across the main genres we normally inhabit and a new one 
we haven't before.

In saying that there is no conscious effort on my part to emulate anybody as after all this time I like to think Stars has is own appeal 
and i've wanted to showcase a certain diversity of sound which will hopefully be of interest to the listener and, a certain groove which in the past
we almost had but not quite which bodes well for live performances.

As for live perfomances we are talking to a few bands, but expect it will be a little while yet (but not too long) as we have to finish the album first 
but as I say I am preparing for this mode switch now.

From the two John's.....
