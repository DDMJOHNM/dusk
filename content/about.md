**Stars and the Underground** 

Is the solo project of John Mason (Winterland) based in Auckland, New Zealand. 

John plays a unique brand of Post Punk incorporating Shoegaze textures and Dark Synthwave vibes.

Joined by a talented group of friends on releases or solo each release has a story of its own and documents another step in the journey of stars.

New material is due in 2023 and this will start with the release of the single Lonely Black Hearts Dismay and working towards some live dates with John Mcdermott on drums joining me.  

The single “Nosferatu Upon Tyne” was released in August 2020 and received airplay in New Zealand, Australia, Mexico, Peru, Argentina, Canada, Greece, Germany, UK, France and the US.

Nosferatu was also included on the US compilation UnObscured Comp Vol 2 2020 along side bands like Altar De Fey Shadow Assembly and Ashes Fallen.

This carried on the great work we started with the release of the Evolution Circle Ep in 2019 and the tour of Australia, also sharing the stage in Auckland with Drab Majesty (US) and Sounds Like Winter (Aus) and Ikon (Aus).
