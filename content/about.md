**Stars and the Underground** 

Stars and the Underground is the the musical project of Auckland, New Zealand based
singer songwriter John Mason. (ex Winterland circa 1999)

Our name suggests a duality between musical textures. Usual motifs include ethereal
and dark musical tones. If you walked into a music store people might file us
alongside other artists and styles but how do you categorise yourself?

If you must then I would prefer it to read something like Goth Adjacent, Post Punk,
Dark Wave and Dark Synthwave and Shoegaze.

But if you were to ignore us due to such categorisation you’d be doing yourself and
us a disservice.

The honest truth is our songs encourage you to look at the darkest of things and
find beauty and peace and freedom of expression within them. They compel the
listener to emerge with a greater sense of purpose and understanding of the events
they communicate something about.

Our single “Nosferatu Upon Tyne” was released in August 2020 and received airplay in New Zealand, Australia, Mexico, Peru, Argentina, Canada, Greece, Germany, UK, France and the US.
Nosferatu was also included on the US compilation UnObscured Comp Vol 2 2020 along side bands like Altar De Fey Shadow Assembly and Ashes Fallen.

2024 marks a rebirth of sorts as we have changed line ups and have a new album
called ‘Guardians of the Night’ in the wings, after almost two years away the first
live shows are being booked.

*Rev Orange Peel, 13thfloor.co.nz*

“Moving through the set that combined facets of post punk, shoe gaze and dark electronic music with vocals from Mason intermingly added in just the right places
Stars and the Underground proved itself to be a worthy live act...”

*Sarah Kidd Ambient Light Blog*
