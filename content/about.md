Dusk Aotearoa is a New Zealand (Aotearoa) based artist collective specialising in Post-Punk, Darkwave and Dark Electronic Music.

John Mason is pictured here with long time friend, collaborator, photographer and videographer Mark Wallbank he works with us on our projects.

Mark was the founder of Club Bizzare a Darkend Label Based in New Zealand home to Hieronymous Bosch and also founded Paranormal Research Group Haunted Auckland.  

Rather than functioning as a old school record label that signs people, we more foster mutually beneficial relationships with other artists, encouraging them
to work with us playing live and helping to build our respective audiences.      

We will concentrate primarily on our own releases, however we haven't ruled out artist compilations in the future.
