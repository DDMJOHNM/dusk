**[vexxed] in my head** are Carlos Antonio of ODD and Humaniser and John Mason of Stars and the Underground and Humaniser. 

Based in tamaki makaurau, this project is quite unique and with the studio as a focal point
material and ideas are passed between the pair with Carlos's remixing ability to the fore dark electronic dancefloor bass driven grooves are created.      

An EP release is planned, major motifs lyrically include alchemy representing change and the deconstruction of the self and emerging rejuvenated and new.

The perfect scene for the lads to re-engage musically.
