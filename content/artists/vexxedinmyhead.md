**VEXXED in my head** is the solo project John Mason of Stars and the Underground. 

Based in tamaki makaurau, major motifs lyrically include alchemy representing change and the deconstruction of the self and emerging rejuvenated and new.

Steeped in sybolism the work has its heart rooted in experimentation.  

The music is designed for the ethereal dark dancefloor!!

John has also been working with Carlos (ODD, Humaniser) who has been remixing the tracks.
