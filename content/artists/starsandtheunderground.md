**Stars and the Underground** Is the solo project of John Mason (Winterland) based in Auckland, New Zealand. 

John plays a unique brand of Post Punk incorporating Shoegaze textures and Dark Synthwave vibes.

Our single “Nosferatu Upon Tyne” was released in August 2020 and received airplay in New Zealand, Australia, Mexico, Peru, Argentina, Canada, Greece, Germany, UK, France and the US.

Nosferatu was also included on the US compilation UnObscured Comp Vol 2 2020 along side bands like Altar De Fey Shadow Assembly and Ashes Fallen.

This carried on the great work we started with the release of the Evolution Circle Ep in 2019 and the tour of Australia, also sharing the stage in Auckland with Drab Majesty (US) and Sounds Like Winter (Aus) and Ikon (Aus).

*Rev Orange Peel, 13thfloor.co.nz*

“Moving through the set that combined facets of post punk, shoe gaze and dark electronic music with vocals from Mason intermingly added in just the right places
Stars and the Underground proved itself to be a worthy live act...”

*Sarah Kidd Ambient Light Blog*
