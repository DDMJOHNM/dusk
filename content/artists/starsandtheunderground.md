**Stars and the Underground** are a four piece band from Auckland, New Zealand. 

They play a unique  brand of Post Punk incorporating Shoegaze textures and Dark Electronic and Cold Wave vibes.

Our journey thus far has been about building a sound of which now we feel we are beginning to understand, as
at 2022 after being dreadfully restricted by Covid19, we are now ready to share our new material which represents the band as it now exists the camaraderie and shared musical connection we have made during difficult times.

Recording an EP is our next port of call, then a return to the touring momentum we started to build in 2019.

Our first single “Nosferatu Upon Tyne” was released in August 2020 and received airplay in New Zealand, Australia, Mexico, Peru, Argentina, Canada, Greece, Germany, UK, France and the US.

Nosferatu was also included on the US compilation UnObscured Comp Vol 2 2020 along side bands like Altar De Fey Shadow Assembly and Ashes Fallen.

We like to think we are doing our little bit to promote not just ourselves but other Kiwi artists.

“Moving through the set that combined facets of post punk, shoe gaze and dark electronic music with vocals from Mason intermingly added in just the right places
Stars and the Underground proved itself to be a worthy live act...”
