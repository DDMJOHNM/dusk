Winterland originally consisted of Mike Caulfield, Glynn Beaumont and Barry Morton, laterly joined by John Mason and Ross Harris who came
togther to form the original band. A rehersal room on Quay Street and almost monthly shows marked our first years in existence.

Gradually as we built our name an audience which culminmated in our first EP release Ceremony, and with its release a distribution deal with Flying Out and
a top ten hit Dreamtime on 95bfm thanks to the kind support of Renee Jones and Phil Armstrong.

Mark Wallbank the head of the Club Bizarre Label took a liking to the band and invited us to play many local Gothic Subculture events and amongst those the very first Nocturne Gothic balls in New Zealand.       

The last show for the original line up was the last Sweetwaters Festival, where we played to 10,000 people on the first night of the festival alongside Jordan Reyne.
