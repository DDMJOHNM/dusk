      <description>Stars and the Underground
Is the solo project of John Mason (Winterland) based in Auckland, New Zealand.
John plays a unique brand of Post Punk incorporating Shoegaze textures and Dark Synthwave vibes.
Joined by a talented group of friends on releases or solo each release has a story of its own and documents another step in the journey of Stars.
New material is due in 2023 and this will start with the release of the single Lonely Black Hearts Dismay and working towards some live dates with John Mcdermott on drums joining me.</description>

      <description>Concierto Solidario - Radio Subte Lima Sur(Peru) Live Stream
  This video was shot for Radio Subte Lima Sur and was played on a big screen at the benefit concert so that the disadvantaged children of Villa María del Triunfo could enjoy some Christmas cheer.
Thank you to the late Daniel D (DANIEL SIEMPRE PRESENTE), Cristian Murillo and Milagros Rivera who supported us by playing Nosferatu Upon Tyne during our single release 2020 during covid.</description>
