            <description>So i&amp;rsquo;d say this recording process is the most isolated I&amp;rsquo;ve ever undertaken, long hours tracking before sending tracks off and thankfully John&amp;rsquo;s been at the other end of line to bounce ideas off of.
If I had my choice it would be different but thats a coversation for another day.
One of the biggest and closest losses of my life happened just recently with my father passing away.</description>

<p>So i&rsquo;d say this recording process is the most isolated I&rsquo;ve ever undertaken, long hours <br>
tracking before sending tracks off and thankfully John&rsquo;s been at the other end of line
to bounce ideas off of.</p>
<p>If I had my choice it would be different but thats a coversation for another day.</p>
<p>One of the biggest and closest losses of my life happened just recently with my father passing
away.</p>
<p>I am and will continue to be for quite some time trying to reconcile what I saw what
happened to him and how quickly it happened.</p>
<p>One part of the Gothic plane to me is that you become familiar with well, darkness.</p>
<p>Unlike what you might think it&rsquo;s not about depression although it could be and there<br>
is no shame in that, it could be about finding beauty in that darkness and in fact you welcome it as a familiar friend.</p>
<p>The sombre tones, the deep resonant lilting drone of that bass, the dry ice, and in those days the entire packet of cigarettes you smoked and hence the smell you tried to get out of clothes for the next week.</p>
<p>The smell of make up, perfume and the audience which always looked better than what we did but overall and overwhelmingly and impressively the warmth of such people that dwealt in the cold.</p>
<p>For me fear has always racked my thoughts, but less and less now as there was always the thought that these
darkest of things that you surround yourself with make it easier to deal with life.</p>
<p>Thats some really bad shit but, that&rsquo;s not really that bad you get desensitised to it, perhaps deliberately.</p>
<p>Thats always why I celebrate the dark and communicate through such a filter, it&rsquo;s not about fashion its not about
knowing whom the lead singer of band x is.</p>
<p>I love those things, but its always about reconciling experiences that you have through this dark filter to find comfort.</p>
<p>By way of example.</p>
<p>The song we are working on at the moment is called &ldquo;Here comes the Midnight Chord&rdquo;</p>
<p>It goes something like&hellip;</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>
Our best laid plans, they come undone 

Opportunity slips through the cracks in the floor

Don't waste the time you have, don't waste it any more  

The days are precious and so are your thoughts


Here comes the Midnight Chord 
theres danger here and chaos involved.


Take Charon's Obel for the trip to underworld  

Our dearest and departed lost across the rivers Styx and Acheron

Honor your loved ones, honor your dead 

They are part of your own ascent

Remember when the cold sets in 

It's their warmth that will never relent


Here comes the Midnight Chord 
theres danger here and chaos involved.


For &quot;Don&quot; Donald Jack Mason  
12th December 1938 - 27th November 2023

            <description>I thought it would be a good idea to start posting and letting people interested in our music what was happening.
Naturally out of habit or poor planning i&amp;rsquo;ve spent alot of time over the hotter months when everybody sensible is out either playing live or enjoying their holidays or concerts inside recording and working toward getting in shape for playing live again.
To date the album &amp;ldquo;Guardians of the Night&amp;rdquo; is well and truely on track with three tracks completed and another three over with John Mcdermott</description>

<p>I thought it would be a good idea to start posting and letting people interested in our music what was happening.</p>
<p>Naturally out of habit or poor planning i&rsquo;ve spent alot of time over the hotter months when everybody sensible is out either playing live
or enjoying their holidays or concerts inside recording and working toward getting in shape for playing live again.</p>
<p>To date the album &ldquo;Guardians of the Night&rdquo; is well and truely on track with three tracks completed and another three over with John Mcdermott<br>
presently.</p>
<p>Once he finishes his drums parts he sends them back for final track laying I send them back to him once i&rsquo;m finished for mix
and mastering.</p>
<p>I think the thing that has surprised me about the new material is the ease with which it straddles across the main genres we normally inhabit and a new one
we haven&rsquo;t before.</p>
<p>In saying that there is no conscious effort on my part to emulate anybody as after all this time I like to think Stars has is own appeal
and i&rsquo;ve wanted to showcase a certain diversity of sound which will hopefully be of interest to the listener and, a certain groove which in the past
we almost had but not quite which bodes well for live performances.</p>
<p>As for live perfomances we are talking to a few bands, but expect it will be a little while yet (but not too long) as we have to finish the album first
but as I say I am preparing for this mode switch now.</p>
<p>From the two John&rsquo;s&hellip;..</p>

            <description>Well here we are, in February this year (2023) I indicated that there would be new material coming.
We were planning to release an Ep but these plans were shelved as Cat left the band then I decided not to continue on in the form that we were in to maintain the integrity of what I was trying to do.
Also due to alot of personal illness, family commitments I decided it would best to take a break from live work so I could focus on recording.</description>

<p>I&rsquo;m happy to say that this has really paid off, John Mcdermott a long time friend and drummer agreed to jump on board and help out with the project and
recording.</p>
<p>This has gone so well infact we have enough material for a new album.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guardians of the Night&rdquo;</p>
<p>The above image is taken from the cover of the first single of the album &ldquo;Lonely Black Hearts Dismay&rdquo;, which also features a remix by Elenor Rayner (Robots In Love).</p>
<p>We are planning live performances to support the release in 2024.</p>
