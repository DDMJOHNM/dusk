Well here we are, in February this year (2023) I indicated that there would be new material coming. 

We were planning to release an Ep but these plans were shelved as Cat left the band then I decided not to continue on in the form that we were in to maintain the integrity 
of what I was trying to do.

Also due to alot of personal illness, family commitments I decided it would best to take a break from live work so I could focus on recording.

I'm happy to say that this has really paid off, John Mcdermott a long time friend and drummer agreed to jump on board and help out with the project and 
recording.

This has gone so well infact we have enough material for a new album. 

"Guardians of the Night"

The above image is taken from the cover of the first single of the album "Lonely Black Hearts Dismay", which also features a remix by Elenor Rayner (Robots In Love).

We are planning live performances to support the release in 2024.
