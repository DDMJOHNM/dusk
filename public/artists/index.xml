      <description>VEXXED in my head is the solo project John Mason of Stars and the Underground.
Based in tamaki makaurau, major motifs lyrically include alchemy representing change and the deconstruction of the self and emerging rejuvenated and new.
2023 will see the release of our new EP &amp;ldquo;Apocalyptic Cowboy&amp;rdquo;
The music can be described as a Dark Synthwave with a good smattering of Bass IV.
  The tracklisting:

      <description>Stars and the Underground are a four piece band from Auckland, New Zealand.
They play a unique brand of Post Punk incorporating Shoegaze textures and Dark Electronic and Cold Wave vibes.
Our journey thus far has been about building a sound of which now we feel we are beginning to understand.
As of 2022 after being dreadfully restricted by Covid19, we are now ready to share our new material which represents the band as it now exists the camaraderie and shared musical connection we have made during difficult times.</description>
